    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <p>
    I finished my degree in Hospitality Management in 2019. And I don't know if
    you heard about it or not, but a few months later the entire world shut down.
    Sinse I wanted to work in hotels in order to deliver the best exerience to my
    customer and I couldn't, I had to start looking for a different course on my
    professional life.
    </p>
    <p>
    That is when I found Product Management, and it was almost love at first
    sight. I could still be close to customers and deliver something that would
    make their lifes better.
    </p>
    <p>
    I started to learn how to code, because I wanted to understand how to better
    communicate with Developers on how to explain to them the vision of the
    product and how we could build it together. For me a team that is united and
    works well toghether will have a much better chance to deliver a product with
    quality and value.
    </p>
    <p>
    I know that my University degree has nothing to do with what I do nowadays,
    however I belive that learning is something we should do until the end of our
    days. Whether is in our personal life and grow as a human being, or in our
    work and develop as a professional.
