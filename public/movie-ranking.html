        <h3>The Last of Us</h3>
        <p>Superb, cinematic, piece of art. This was one of the best TV Shows of the last years. Loved it 10/10.</p>
        <h3>Poker Face</h3>
        <p>Natasha Lionne is amazing in everything she does. And although I enjoyed more The Russian Doll this is also realy great and made laugh (when didn't make me cry). 8/10</p>
